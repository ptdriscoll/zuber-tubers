				<p>The Healthy Kids Project features the zany and loveable Zuber Tubers (and their nemeses Sugar Baddie and The Cupcakes) in ten 60-second animated musical videos. The project is designed to educate and excite K-2nd graders on key health concepts to help prevent childhood obesity, diabetes and related illnesses. 
				</p>
				<p>The project teaches not only successful actions (limiting refined sugar, choosing water as a beverage, choosing fresh foods over processed foods), but also successful strategies (valuing the body, not letting past mistakes impede future success, taking one step at a time toward a goal, helping others to make good choices).
				</p>
				<p>The videos are accompanied by <a href="http://www.klrn.org/healthy-kids/" target="_blank">Teacher Resources</a>, which fulfill Texas state mandated requirements for reading, math, science, or social studies.  It's a turnkey kit for teachers to impart critical life lessons about health, without taking time away from core subjects.
				</p>
				<p class="lastparagraph">The Healthy Kids Project videos are the first of many Zuber Tuber adventures to come!</p>
